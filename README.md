# Plant Wa-Tor

This is a program based on the description of a planet of the same name in the book "The Armchair Universe" by A.K.Dewdney (chapter "Sharks and Fish on Planet Wa-Tor).

It describes a world that is a torus. This is gives a rectangular world the properties that going north wraps back to the south of the world, and east wraps to the west. The overall principles of the world is that it is a water planet inhabited by sharks and fish. Both move randomly every tick and will breed after a number of ticks. The sharks also can starve after a set number of ticks and must eat nearby fish to sustain themselves (eating is classed as a move).

I decided to write a program based on this description to get some experience programming with Python and QT. This project is currently still in development but the idea will be to allow the user to experiment with different settings and watch the outcome over time.
